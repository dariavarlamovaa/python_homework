In the case of computing a factorial, there is no compelling reason for preferring recursion over a direct iteration with a loop.
As a more complex example of the use of recursion, consider how to draw the markings of a typical English ruler.
For each inch, we place a tick with a numeric label.
We denote the length of the tick designating a whole inch as the major tick length.
Between the marks for whole inches, the ruler contains a series of minor ticks, placed at intervals of 1/2 inch, 1/4 inch, and so on.
As the size of the interval decreases by half, the tick length decreases by one.
Figure 4.2 demonstrates several such rulers with varying major tick lengths (although not drawn to scale).
